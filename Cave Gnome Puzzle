#Cave gnome puzzle#
##Solution:##

Prior to any of the cave gnomes leaving the cave, they agree that the first gnome will be positioning them and they will stand where the first gnome places them.  The first gnome leaves and puts a rock or other marker in the center of the clearing.  This will be his place at the end of the sorting.  As gnomes exit the cave, the first gnome positions the red gnomes in a line to the right of the rock and the blue gnomes in a line to the left of the rock.  After all the gnomes have exited, the first gnome removes the rock and stands in its place.  

It became apparent fairly early that one gnome would need to operate as an outsider to start the sorting process: if you don’t know the color on your own forehead, you cannot sort yourself into a group.  If you have an outsider doing the sorting, the process is fairly easy and requires no communication.  The trick was figuring out how to get the outsider to then sort himself into a group without knowing the color on his own forehead and without communicating with the group.  This solution gets around the issue by putting the gnome in a situation where there was no wrong answer.  The first gnome does not need to know his own color: either way, he will be the first gnome of either group.

The solution below would work as well.  While in the cave, all the gnomes agree that they will follow a given set of rules: 

- when a gnome puts his hand on your shoulders, you identify the color of that gnome’s forehead and put your hands on the shoulder of a gnome 
	1. with the same color forehead 
	2. that is not already linked to another gnome 
- If you cannot find a gnome that fills these two qualifications, do nothing until you find a gnome that does.  

The first gnome to leave the cave has an additional rule to follow: 

- you will put the hands of one red-forehead gnome on the shoulders of another red-forehead gnome once you are able to do so.
- you will do the same thing with two blue-forehead gnomes once you are able to do so.
- after you have done this, follow the rules the other gnomes are following.

In this way, one gnome starts the process and then the rest of the gnomes continue until done.  When finished, you should have two lines of gnomes linked together hands to shoulders: one with solely red-forehead gnomes and one with solely blue.
