#Cat Weight puzzle#
##Solution:##

**The weights of the tarot reader’s cats is most likely 2 kg, 3 kg and 6 kg.**

The most useful clue initially is the knowledge that the weights of all three cats multiplied together will equal 36.  I started by finding all the combinations of three whole numbers that you could multiply together to get 36.
 
- 1 x 1 x 36	
- 1 x 2 x 18	
- 1 x 3 x 12	
- 1 x 4 x 9	
- 1 x 6 x 6	
- 2 x 2 x 9	
- 2 x 3 x 6	
- 3 x 3 x 4 

Next, I needed to eliminate any answers that seemed unreasonable.  I assumed that the tarot reader’s cats were probably house cats and not tigers or other large cats that might be considered unwise to keep indoors.  This meant I could eliminate any solutions  containing factors larger than 9, because a 36 kg house cat would be ludicrous and a 12 kg or 18 kg would be unusually large (assuming the cat isn’t a Maine Coon, that is) and not likely to be prize-winners. What we're left with is:

- 1 x 4 x 9
- 1 x 6 x 6
- 2 x 2 x 9
- 2 x 3 x 6
- 3 x 3 x 4

Similarly, I eliminated the remaining solutions that contained a factor of 1, because a 1 kg cat would be not much more than a kitten.  This left three fairly plausible solutions:

- 2 x 2 x 9
- 2 x 3 x 6
- 3 x 3 x 4

If I assume that Sammy is the smallest because he is significantly smaller than both of the remaining two cats, the most likely solution would be **2 kg, 3 kg and 6 kg**.

I came by my solution having to make certain assumptions because some of the knowledge I needed wasn’t available.  If I had known the price of a tarot reading, the solution would have much easier.  3 x 3 x 4 is also a fairly plausible answer, as the average house cat should be within 3-5 kg.  And of course, if forced to abandon all assumptions, any of the 8 combinations above could be likely.
